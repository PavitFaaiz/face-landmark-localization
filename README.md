<h1>face-landmark-localization</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
This is a Keras implementation of a simple face landmark localization model. It is implemented by adding a global average pooling and a dense output layer to a infamous pretrained networks (provided by Keras).

<h2>Dataset</h2>
The dataset used here is MUCT face database consisting of 3,755 faces each with 76 hand labeled landmarks. The dataset can be found at: https://github.com/StephenMilborrow/muct.
